Got a little experiment idea if you guys want to help me out at all? Basically - I've started recording/reviewing basic daily conversations I have, and distilling them into relatively simple sets of sentences. What I want to do is gather as many of these as I can over the course of a few weeks/months etc, then use some NLP to figure out which sorts of sentences are most common
