# Sentences *(Needs a better name)*

## Aims of the project:
1. To assemble a representative list of the x most useful sentences in English that any language learner - beyond the level of absolute beginner - can have translated and recorded into their target language and learn.
2. To assemble translations and audio recordings of these sentences, further reducing the work required to assemble a suitable list of sentences.
3. Provide an application that automates scheduling when and how to learn these sentences.
4. Provide a mechanism by which the underlying corpus can be iterated upon by the community.

### Motiviation:
* Many amazing word frequency lists and pronunciation dictionairies.
* Words are problematic for learning a language, sentences are better.
* Many very expensive services provide something similar (Glossika, Primsleur). Lack of transparancy
* No open source alternatives
* Most "sentence dictionairies" provide no weighting to a sentence. All are treated equally, and I hypothesise this is not the case for language acquisition.
* Most of the (at least my own personal) time spent learning a language deals with the question "what should I learn next?". This project will provide a clear list of what to learn that should carry a learner far into grasping the core of a language.

### Core assumptions (to be substantiated)
* Natural speech occuring from daily interactions includes mostly often-repeated sentence patterns or even entire sentences.
* While no two speakers will use the same language or style, there will be large overlapping regions between all speakers, especially when it comes to achieving commonly shared goals on a daily basis.
* It will be possible to detect these recurring patterns or overlapping regions and provide a meaningful ordering based on the frequency-of-use of a sentence.
* Any "good" sentence - that is one which provides enough enclosed context to be understood in one language - can be fully translated into another.
* This ordering by frequency-of-use will not be (too severely) lost in translation to another language.
* One can achieve a high level of fluency in a language from a relatively small number of sentences (less than in the order of a few thousand).

### To Do (not necessarily in order):
* Research the core assumptions a bit further.
* Design the underlaying corpus to be created and used, what will be allowed in and what should be filtered out.
* Provide a mechanism for anonymous contribution (we also want to include vulgar, intimate and even incriminating language) for growing the corpus.
* Figure out how to decide if two sentences are similar in either structure or meaning
* List the sentences in order of greatest similarity with other sentences.
* Find translaters and speakers for work through all the sentences available.
* Evaluate the quality of two sets of translations, for example compare French and German after both have been translated from English. Can a French speaker then use the German list while avoiding the English list altogether? 
* Rinse and repeat.
