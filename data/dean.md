### Lunch time
* Hey, what are your lunch plans? Want to come and get a burrito with me?
* Can I bring you back anything for lunch?
* Let's meet back here in 45 minutes.

### Discussing your weekend
* Madrid is not a friendly place for Vegans.
* There is this good app, however, that just lists all the Vegan restaurants in your area.
* That's one thing I appreciate there. If you ask them if they speak English, they just say "no".
* It really forced me to use my Spanish - I don't like sounding like a tourist when I travel somewhere.

### Course at work
* Would you rather do long sessions with longer pauses, or shorter sessions with shorter pauses?

### Ask someone for something:
* Could you please make me a coffee? - No, get it yourself.

### Discussing working hours
* So, get this: I start work at my other job tonight at 11:30 and I finish there around 4am, then I have to be back here at 7!
* You're going to be dead tomorrow!
* The worst part is I have to stay longer than normal tomorrow to clean up after lunch.
* What time did you get off work today?

### Discussing after-work plans:
* Are you going to training tonight?
* No, forgot to bring my sports stuff. I won't have time to go home, so I think I'll just skip this evening.
* We have the Christmas party on Thursday.

### Meeting your neighbour in the hallway
* Hey, good morning!
* Oh hey, you just caught me sorting out all my junk mail.
* How was the rest your day yesterday?
* Good, I helped my roommate move the rest of her stuff out of the apartment.
* Looking forward to going back home?
* I hope my suitcase isn't too heavy? - Nah, what's the limit, 23kg? I don't think this thing ways more than 15kg.
* You're back on the 10th of January, right? - yup, that's right.

### Meet a friend:
* Hey, good morning! Sorry I'm running late, I just bumped into my neighbour on the way out.
* She's going home to Canada for Christmas, so I thought I should be polite and say hello.
* How was the rest of your weekend after Friday evening?
* Are you sore from rock climbing?

### Describe a tough day:
* Yesterday sucked!
* I woke up at 11:30 completely hungover and I had to meet the dogowner at 12:00.
* So I messaged him and said let's meet at 2 as there was no way I was going to make it before 1pm.
* I then slept for another hour.
* But on the way to meet him, our car broke down!
* He came and met us instead, so that was fine, but we sat in the car for hours waiting for the tow-truck to arrive.
* They always put a higher priority on cars that break down on the freeway, and it's a Sunday, so it took ages.
* Then for insurance reasons, we had to ride with the tow-truck back to the garage.
* We finally had a working car again, and went to dinner. It was then around 6pm.
* We were both absolutely freezing, so we were sitting there in the restaurant with our jackets on.
* When we got home, I just took a warm bath and went straight to bed.
* Ah, I thought something must have been wrong when you said you were going straight to bed.

### You message a friend with the intent to make a short-term plan
* Hey! What are you up to tonight/this afternoon?
* Hey, do you feel like going to brunch tomorrow morning?
* I'm in the mood for..., want to join me?
* I can always come by yours if that's easier for you.

### Responses
* I have a friend visiting and she's not leaving until 8:30, after that I'm going straight to bed.
* Sorry, I don't feel like doing much tonight, I'm exhausted!
* Yes! I could really go for some dumplings.
* Hey, I'm unfortunately not feeling great tonight, so I'll have to skip.
* What time were you thinking?

### Apologies to delayed responses
* Sorry, I left my phone on silent and didn't get your message.
* Sorry, work has been really busy recently and I haven't had time to reply.
* I'm sorry, I was exhausted last night and didn't respond to any messages.

### Cancelling plans
* Oh, I just realized that Wednesday is the 20th. Unfortunately I have a party to go to/I already said I'd go to a friends party.
* No problem - I don't mind staying up later on Thursday, we can always meet up a little bit later if you want.
* Sure, let me find out tomorrow and figure out what the best plan would be.
* It might make more sense if I come to yours then.

### A friend messages to ask you to give someone something:
* Would I be able to pass your number onto Maria so she can organise to meet you?
* Are you able to give Tom the letter tomorrow morning?
* Now you have my number. Message me if you ever need anything!
* Hi Tom, it's Maria, I got your number off of Omar.
* Can we meet some time this week so I can get the keys off of you?

### Asking something a quick question
* Hey, how was the movie? Random question - how do you best translate ... into ...?

### Apologies
* Sorry again about this morning - I didn't mean to be insensitive.

### Person at counter asks for the next customer
* Who's next?
* Next, please

### Polite greetings

* What can I do for you?

### Recommondetations from staff:
* I can really recommend the cheesecake.

### Order something
* I would like a sandwich with egg and cheese
* Do you sell tea? Then I'll have a tea with ginger and lemon, please.

* Would it be possible to get a mixed salad with meat?

### Additions to Order
* Would you like that to be warmed up?
* Would you like the one with cheese, egg or salami?
* Would you like full cream milk?
* Is skim milk okay?
* Which ingredients would you like in your salad?
* Would you like oil or vinegar on your salad?

### Handle missing ingredients

* Are you paying for both?
* I'll also pay for my friends here.
* What would you like?

* I'm not sure, let me ask her.

### You're now a local
* Americano, right? - No, I'm Australian - Ugh, I meant you normally take an americano, no?

* I hope it's for tomorrow? - Should I bring one [tomorrow]? - Why not?
* Are you watching something? - No, I was just listening to a podcast

### 21.12.17
* I just loved how our new CEO made jokes about his ex-wife
  * No, they were about his current wife, and I didn't find them very funny.
  * Really? No, they can't have been? Who would make jokes like that about the person they're married to?
  * My parents got divorced over 10 years ago, and they behave like absolute children to each other.
  * I guess I just assumed anyone who makes jokes like that about someone can't be married to them.
* The trains aren't running anymore and I have to be at work at 7:30!
  * I'm sure you can stay at either Mascha's, or you can stay at mine. We live only about 30 minutes away by foot.
  * Okay, I'll stay at yours, but I'm sleeping on the couch! - you have a couch, don't you?
  * I actually have a whole guest bed for you.
* You'll have to excuse my apartment, it's a little bit untidy - See! Look at all this rubbish in the hallway.
* You really need something for your walls - they're so white!
* Do you also have an iPhone charger at your place?
  * I do - oh, crap, wait - I left it in my bag in the office.
  * That's okay, are you able to set an alarm for me?
  * Yeah, sure. I'll set an alarm and get you up when it goes off.
  * Hmm, actually, I don't trust you. Can have just borrow your phone? When it goes off, I can come and give it to you, then you can sleep in.
* I also have an electronic toothbrush head for you.
  * Oh, thanks, but aren't they really expensive? - Oh, don't worry about it.
  * I just left the toothbrush head here next to the toothbrush for you.
  * Do you use an electric toothbrush at home as well? - of course!
* You do you also have the morning toothpaste? Did you know this one is just for evenings? It's less powerful.
  * No, I didn't! I think I know what you're talking about though. I think I've seen it at the shops.
* Morning! Just wanted to check that you're awake. - Yeah, I am, I'm just resting a little.
  * Be careful you don't fall back asleep - I won't!
  * Can I have my phone back? I'm going back to bed and need the alarm in an hour and a half.
* Oh my god - I just realised I don't have a lighter. I'll be right back.
* Excuse me, does anyone here have a lighter? 

### 22.12.17
* Are you alright? - Oh fuck.. just woke up... I'll be at work in an hour.
* I did that thing where I dreamt about my alarm clock going off. I somehow turned if off without remembering, and woke up 2 hours later.
* Thanks for letting me stay at yours last night - Of course, no problem! Did you get to work on time?
* Is there something wrong with the backup server today? My test app isn't working.
* I love this camembert cheese! - really, I hate it - What?!, what is wrong with you? :P
* I totally slept in... Feeling pretty good now though.
* (Jokingly:) Can we have one day where you don't make fun of me? - Sorry, my default is just to give everyone a hard time.
* I may have actually influenced Alex's decision to stay at yours last night - yeah? how so?
* We spoke in the bathroom briefly. I just asked her why she's so afraid. Dean's a nice guy: he stays at my place all the time!
* Merry Christmas! - (joking:) I'm not a Christian, I don't know what Christmas is.
