* Hey, do you feel like going to brunch tomorrow morning?
* I'm in the mood for..., want to join me?

### Responses

* Sorry, I don't feel like doing much tonight, I'm exhausted!
* Yes! I could really go for some dumplings.
* Hey, I'm unfortunately not feeling great tonight, so I'll have to skip.
* What time were you thinking?

### Apologies to delayed responses
* Sorry, I left my phone on silent and didn't get your message.
* Sorry, work has been really busy recently and I haven't had time to reply.
* I'm sorry, I was exhausted last night and didn't respond to any messages.

### Cancelling plans
